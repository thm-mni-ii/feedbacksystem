As a student you have to submit a lot of tasks
for your lectures. And usually the only reply you
get is that you passed or not. This is a situation
we want to change.
Feedbacksystem is a system to automatically check
your submissions and give an immediate result.
With the result we want to provide suggestions
to the students about their mistakes.
But also collect the most common mistakes and
present them to the lecturer such that they
can address them in the lectures.
